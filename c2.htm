 Chapter 2

In the name of God, the Almighty, the Most Merciful
 
1. A.L.M. 
  
  2. This is the Scripture in which there is no doubt, a guide for the righteous. 
  
  
  3. Those who believe in the unseen, and uphold the salat, and from Our provisions 
  to them they spend. 
  
  4. And those who believe in what was sent down to you, and what was sent down 
  before you, and regarding the Hereafter they are aware. 
  
  5. These are the ones guided by their Lord, and these are the winners. 
  
  6. As for those who reject, whether you warn them or do not warn them, they 
  will not believe. 
  
  7. God has sealed over their hearts and over their ears, and over their eyes 
  are covers. They will incur a great retribution. 
  
  8. And from the people are those who say: We believe in God and in the 
  last day, but they are not believers. 
  
  9. They attempt to deceive God and those who believe, but they only deceive 
  themselves without noticing. 
  
  10. In their hearts is a disease, so God increases their disease, and they will 
  have a painful retribution for what they have denied. 
  
  11. And if they are told: Do not make mischief on Earth, they say: 
  But we are the reformers! 
  
  12. No, they are the mischief makers, but they do not perceive. 
  
  13. And if they are told: Believe, as the people have believed, 
  they say: Shall we believe as the fools have believed? No, they 
  are the fools but they do not know. 
  
  14. And if they come across those who have believed, they say: We believe, 
  and when they are alone with their devils they say: We are with you, we 
  were only mocking.
  
  15. God mocks them, and leaves them prolonged in their transgression. 
  
  16. These are the ones who have purchased straying for guidance, their trade 
  did not profit them, nor were they guided. 
  
  17. Their example is like one who lights a fire, so when it illuminates what 
  is around him, God takes away his light and leaves him in the darkness not seeing. 
  
  
  18. Deaf, dumb, and blind, they will not revert. 
  
  19. Or as a cloud from the sky, in it are darkness and thunder and lightning. 
  They place their fingers in their ears from the lightning strikes out of fear 
  of death; but God is aware of the rejecters. 
  
  20. The lightning nearly snatches away their sight, whenever it lights the path 
  they walk in it, and when it becomes dark on them they stand. Had God willed, 
  He would have taken away their hearing and their sight; God is capable of all 
  things. 
  
  21. O people, serve your Lord who has created you and those before you that 
  you may be righteous. 
  
  22. The One who made the land a habitat, and the sky a structure, and He sent 
  down from the sky water with which He brought-out fruit as a gift to you. So 
  do not take any equals with God while you now know. 
  
  23. And if you are in doubt as to what We have sent down to Our servant, then 
  bring a chapter like this, and call upon your witnesses other than God if you 
  are truthful. 
  
  24. And if you cannot do this; and you will not be able to do this; then beware 
  the fire whose fuel is people and stones, it has been prepared for the rejecters. 
  
  
  25. And give tidings to those who believe and do good works, that they will 
  have gardens with rivers flowing beneath, every time they receive of its fruit, 
  they say: This is what we have been provided before, and they will 
  be given its likeness, and there they will have pure mates, and in it they will 
  abide. 
  
  26. God does not shy away from citing the example of a mosquito, or anything 
  above it. As for those who believe, they know that it is the truth from their 
  Lord. As for the rejecters, they say: What does God want with this example? 
  He lets many stray by it, and He guides many, but He only lets stray the evildoers. 
  
  
  27. The ones who break their pledge to God after making its covenant, and they 
  sever what God had ordered to be delivered. And they make corruption on earth; 
  these are the losers. 
  
  28. How can you reject God when you were dead and He brought you to life? Then 
  He makes you die, then He brings you to life, then to Him you return. 
  
  29. He is the One who created for you all that is on Earth, then He tended to 
  the heaven and made it seven heavens, and He is aware of all things. 
  
  30. And your Lord said to the Angels: I am placing a successor on earth 
  They said: Would You place in it those who would corrupt in it, and spill 
  blood, while we sing your glory, and praise You? He said: I know 
  what you do not know.
  
  31. And He taught Adam the description of all things, then He displayed them 
  to the Angels and said: Inform Me the descriptions of these things if 
  you are truthful.
  
  32. They said: Glory be to You, we have no knowledge except that which 
  You have taught us, You are the Knowledgeable, the Wise. 
  
  33. He said: O Adam, inform them of these descriptions, so when 
  he informed them the descriptions, He said: Did I not tell you that I 
  know the unseen of heavens and earth, and that I know what you reveal and what 
  you were hiding? 
  
  34. And We said to the Angels: Submit to Adam, so they submitted 
  except for Satan, he refused and became arrogant, and became of the rejecters. 
  
  
  35. And We said: O Adam, reside you and your mate in the Garden, and eat 
  from it bountifully as you both wish, and do not approach this tree, else you 
  will be of those who do wrong. 
  
  36. So, the devil tricked them from it, and he brought them out from what they 
  were in, and We said: Descend, you are enemies of one another, and on 
  earth you shall have stability and luxury for a while. 
  
  37. Adam then received words from His Lord, so He forgave him; He is the Forgiver, 
  the Merciful.
  
  38. We said: Descend from it all of you, so when the guidance comes from 
  Me, then whoever follows My guidance, they will have nothing to fear, nor will 
  they grieve.
  
  39. And those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations, they are the dwellers 
  of Hell, in it they will abide. 
  
  40. O Children of Israel, remember My blessings that I had blessed you with, 
  and fulfill your pledge to Me that I may fulfill My pledge to you, and revere 
  Me alone. 
  
  41. And believe in what I have sent down, authenticating what is already with 
  you, and do not be the first to disbelieve in it! And do not purchase with My 
  verses a cheap gain, and of Me you shall be aware. 
  
  42. And do not confound the truth with falsehood, and keep the truth secret 
  while you know. 
  
  43. And uphold the salat, and contribute to the zakat, and yield yourselves 
  with those who have yielded. 
  
  44. Do you order the people to do good, but forget yourselves, while you are 
  reciting the Scripture? Do you not understand? 
  
  45. And seek help through patience, and the salat. It is a difficult thing, 
  but not so for the humble.
  
  46. The ones who think they will meet their Lord and that to Him they will return. 
  
  
  47. O Children of Israel, remember My blessings that I had blessed you with, 
  and that I had preferred you to all the worlds! 
  
  48. And beware of a day where no soul can avail another soul, nor will any intercession 
  be accepted from it, nor will any ransom be taken, nor will they have supporters. 
  
  
  49. And We saved you from the people of Pharaoh; they were punishing you with 
  severe retribution, killing your children, and raping your women. In that was 
  a great trial from your Lord. 
  
  50. And We split the sea for you, thus We saved you and drowned the people of 
  Pharaoh while you were watching. 
  
  51. And We appointed a meeting time for Moses of forty nights, but then you 
  took the calf after him while you were wicked. 
  
  52. Then We forgave you after that, perhaps you would be thankful. 
  
  53. And We gave Moses the Scripture and the criterion, perhaps you would be 
  guided. 
  
  54. And Moses said to his people: O my people, you have wronged your souls 
  by taking the calf, so repent to your Maker, and kill yourselves. That is better 
  for you with your Maker, so He would forgive you. He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. 
  
  
  55. And you said: O Moses, we will not believe you until we see God openly! 
  So the lightning bolt took you while you were still watching. 
  
  56. Then we resurrected you after your death that you may be appreciative. 
  
  57. And We shaded you with clouds, and sent down to you manna and quails. Eat 
  from the goodness of the provisions We have provided you. They did not wrong 
  Us, but it was their souls that they wronged. 
  
  58. And We said: Enter this town, and eat from it as plentifully as you 
  wish; and enter the door in submission, and say: our load is removed, 
  We will then forgive your mistakes, and We will increase for the good doers.
  
  59. But the wicked altered what was said to them for a different saying, thus 
  We sent down upon the wicked a punishment from the heaven for what they had 
  transgressed. 
  
  60. And Moses was seeking water for his people, so We said: Strike the 
  rock with your staff. Thus twelve springs burst out of it; each tribe 
  then knew from where to drink. Eat and drink from God's provisions, and 
  do not roam the earth as corruptors. 
  
  61. And you said: O Moses, we will not be patient to one type of food, 
  so call for us your Lord that He may bring forth what the earth grows of its 
  beans, cucumbers, garlic, lentils, and onions. He said: Would you 
  trade that which is lowly with that which is good? Descend to Egypt, you 
  will have in it what you have asked for. They were thus stricken with humiliation 
  and disgrace, and they remained under God's wrath for they were disbelieving 
  in God's signs, and killing the prophets with no justification; this is for 
  what they have disobeyed and transgressed. 
  
  62. Surely those who believe, and those who are Jewish, and the Nazarenes, and 
  the reverts; any one of them who believes in God and the last day, and does 
  good work, they will have their reward with their Lord, with no fear over them, 
  nor will they grieve. 
  
  63. And We took your covenant, and raised the mount above you; Take what 
  We have given you with strength, and remember what is in it that you may be 
  righteous. 
  
  64. Then you turned away after this. And had it not been for God's favour upon 
  you and His mercy, you would have been of the losers. 
  
  65. You have come to know who it was amongst you that aggressed during the Sabbath, 
  We said to them: Be despicable apes!
  
  66. And We did this as a punishment for what they had done in it and also afterwards, 
  and a reminder to the righteous. 
  
  67. And Moses said to his people: God orders you to slaughter a heifer 
  They said: Do you mock us? He said: I seek refuge with God 
  that I not be of the ignorant ones.
  
  68. They said: Call upon your Lord for us that He may clarify which it 
  is He said: He says it is a heifer neither too old nor too young, 
  an age between that. So now do as you are commanded.
  
  69. They said: Call upon your Lord for us that He may clarify what color 
  it is He said: He says it is a yellow heifer with a strong color, 
  pleasing to those who see it. 
  
  70. They said: Call upon your Lord for us that He may clarify which one 
  it is, for the heifers all look alike to us and we will, God willing, be guided. 
  
  
  71. He said: He says it is a heifer which was never subjugated to plough 
  the land, or water the crops, free from any blemish They said: Now 
  you have come with the truth And they slaughtered it, though they had 
  nearly not done so. 
  
  72. And you had murdered a person, then disputed in the matter; God was to bring 
  out what you were keeping secret. 
  
  73. We said: Strike him with parts from it. It is thus that God 
  brings the dead to life, and He shows you His signs that you may comprehend. 
  
  
  74. Then your hearts became hardened after that, they became like stone or even 
  harder; but even from the stones there are rivers that burst forth, or from 
  them are those that crack so that the water comes forth, or from them are what 
  fall from the fear of God; God is not unaware of what you do. 
  
  75. Did you expect that they would believe with you, when a group of them had 
  heard God's words then altered them knowingly after having understood? 
  
  76. And when they come across those who believe, they say: we believe!, 
  and when they are alone with each other they say: Why do you inform them 
  about what God has said to us? Then they would use it in argument against us 
  at your Lord. Do you not understand?
  
  77. Do they not know that God knows what they conceal and what they declare? 
  
  
  78. And amongst them are gentiles who do not know the Scripture except by hearsay, 
  and they can only assume. 
  
  79. So woe to those who write the Scripture with their hands then say: This 
  is from God, so that they can seek a cheap gain! Woe to them for what 
  their hands have written and woe to them for what they gained. 
  
  80. And they said: The fire will not touch us except a limited number 
  of days Say: Have you taken a pledge with God? If so, then God will 
  not break His pledge. Or do you say about God what you do not know? 
  
  81. Indeed, whoever gains a sin, and is surrounded by his mistakes; those are 
  the people of the Fire, in it they abide eternally. 
  
  82. And those who believe and do good work, they are the people of Paradise, 
  in it they abide eternally. 
  
  83. And We took the covenant of the Children of Israel: You shall not 
  serve except God, and regard your parents, and regard the relatives, and orphans, 
  and needy, and say kind things to the people, and uphold the salat, and contribute 
  to the zakat. But then you turned away, except a few of you; you were 
  objecting. 
  
  84. And We have taken a covenant with you: You shall not spill each other's 
  blood, nor drive each other out from your homes. Then you agreed to this 
  while bearing witness. 
  
  85. But then here you are killing each other and driving out a group of you 
  from their homes; you act towards them with evil and animosity. And if they 
  come to you as prisoners, you ransom them while it was forbidden for you to 
  drive them out! Do you believe in some of the Scripture and disbelieve in some? 
  The punishment for those amongst you who do so is humiliation in this worldly 
  life, and on the day of resurrection they will be returned to the most severe 
  retribution. God is not unaware of what you all do. 
  
  86. These are the ones who have purchased this worldly life instead of the Hereafter. 
  The retribution will not be reduced for them, nor will they be supported. 
  
  87. And We gave Moses the Scripture, and after him we sent the messengers. And 
  We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear proofs, and We supported Him with the Holy 
  Spirit. Is it that every time a messenger comes to you with what your souls 
  do not desire, you become arrogant? A group of them you deny, and a group of 
  them you kill! 
  
  88. And they said: Our hearts are sealed! No, it is God who has 
  cursed them for their rejection, for very little do they believe. 
  
  89. And when a scripture came to them from God, authenticating what is with 
  them; while before that they were mocking those who rejected; so when what they 
  knew came to them, they rejected it! God's curse be upon the rejecters. 
  
  90. Miserable indeed is what they purchase with their souls, that they disbelieve 
  in what God Has sent down as resentment that God would send down from His grace 
  to whom He pleases of His servants; thus they have incurred wrath upon wrath. 
  And the rejecters will have a humiliating retribution. 
  
  91. And if it is said to them: Believe in what God Has sent down; 
  they say: We believe only in what was sent down to us and they reject 
  what came after it, while it is the truth authenticating what is with them. 
  Say: Why then did you kill God's prophets if you were believers? 
  
  
  92. And Moses had come to you with clear proofs, then you took the calf after 
  him; you were wicked! 
  
  93. And We took your covenant, and raised the mount above you: Take what 
  We have given you with strength, and listen They said: We hear and 
  disobey!, and they had consumed the calf inside their hearts by their 
  disbelief. Say: Miserable indeed is what your belief orders of you if 
  you are believers! 
  
  94. Say: If the abode of the Hereafter has been set exclusively for you 
  to the exception of all other people, then you should wish for death if you 
  are truthful! 
  
  95. They will never wish for it because of what their hands have done; and God 
  is aware of the wicked. 
  
  96. And you will find them the most obsessive people regarding long life; as 
  well as those who have set-up partners; each one of them wishes that he could 
  live a thousand years. It will not change for him the retribution even if he 
  lived so long, God is watchful over what you do. 
  
  97. Say: Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel, then know that he has sent it 
  down into your heart by God's permission, authenticating what is already present, 
  and a guide and good news for the believers. 
  
  98. Whoever was an enemy to God and His Angels, and His messengers, and 
  Gabriel, and Michael, then so God is the enemy to the disbelievers.
  
  99. We have sent down to you clear verses; only the evil ones would disbelieve 
  in them. 
  
  100. Is it that each time they make a pledge, a group of them breaks it? Alas, 
  most of them do not believe. 
  
  101. And when a messenger came to them from God, authenticating what was with 
  them, a group of those who had already received the scripture placed God's scripture 
  behind their backs as if they did not know. 
  
  102. And they followed what the devils recited regarding Solomon's kingship. 
  Solomon did not reject, but it was the devils that rejected by teaching people 
  magic, and teaching them what was sent down on the two Angels in Babylon, Haroot 
  and Maroot. They did not teach anyone until they would say: We are a test, 
  so do not disbelieve! Thus they teach what can separate a person and his 
  mate; but they cannot harm anyone except by God's permission. And they learn 
  what harms them and does not benefit them, and they have known that he who is 
  a slave to his money has no place in the Hereafter. Miserable indeed is what 
  they purchased with their souls if only they knew! 
  
  103. And had they believed and been righteous, it would have brought them a 
  reward with God which is far better if they knew! 
  
  104. O you who believe, do not say: Look after us, but say: Be 
  patient with us, and listen. For the rejecters is a painful retribution. 
  
  
  105. Neither do those who have rejected from among the people of the scripture, 
  nor from among those who have set-up partners, wish that any good comes down 
  to you from your Lord. But God chooses with His mercy whom He wishes; and from 
  God is the greatest favour. 
  
  106. We do not duplicate a revelation, or make it forgotten, unless We bring 
  one which is like it or even greater. Did you not know that God is capable of 
  all things? 
  
  107. Did you not know that to God is the kingship of the heavens and earth, 
  and that you do not have besides God any guardian or supporter? 
  
  108. Or do you want to ask your messenger as Moses was asked before? Whoever 
  replaces belief with rejection, he has indeed strayed from the right path. 
  
  109. Many of the people of the scripture have wished that they could return 
  you to being rejecters after your believing, out of envy from their souls after 
  the truth was made clear to them. You shall forgive them and overlook until 
  God brings His will. God is capable of all things. 
  
  110. And uphold the salat, and contribute to the zakat, and what you bring forth 
  of good for your souls you will find it with God. God is watching what you do. 
  
  
  111. And they said: None shall enter Paradise except those who are Jewish 
  or Nazarenes; this is what they wish. Say: Bring forth your proof 
  if you are truthful.
  
  112. No, it is the one who complies himself to God, while doing good, he will 
  have his reward with his Lord. There will be no fear over them, nor will they 
  grieve. 
  
  113. And the Jews said: The Nazarenes have no basis, and the Nazarenes 
  said: The Jews have no basis, while they are both reciting the scripture! 
  Similarly, those who do not know have said the same thing. God will judge between 
  them on the day of resurrection in what they disputed. 
  
  114. And who are more wicked than those who boycott God's temples; so that His 
  name not be mentioned in them; and they seek there destruction? They will not 
  be able to enter them except in fear; they will have humiliation in this world 
  and in the Hereafter a painful retribution. 
  
  115. And to God belongs the east and the west, so wherever you turn, there is 
  God's direction. God is Encompassing, Knowledgeable. 
  
  116. And they said: God Has taken a son! Be He glorified. To Him 
  is all that is in the heavens and in the earth, all are humbled to Him. 
  
  117. Initiator of heavens and earth, when He decrees a command, He merely says 
  to it: Be and it is. 
  
  118. And those who do not know said: If only God would speak to us, or 
  a sign would come to us. It is the same thing that the people before them 
  have said, their hearts are so similar! We have clarified the signs for a people 
  who comprehend. 
  
  119. We have sent you with the truth as a bearer of good news and warner. You 
  will not be asked about the people of Hell. 
  
  120. Neither the Jews nor the Nazarenes will be pleased with you until you follow 
  their creed. Say: The guidance is God's guidance And if you follow 
  their wishes after the knowledge that has come to you, then there is none who 
  can help or protect you against God. 
  
  121. Those to whom We have given the scripture and they recite it as it truthfully 
  deserves to be recited; they believe in it. As for those who disbelieve in it, 
  they are the losers. 
  
  122. O Children of Israel, remember My blessings that I have bestowed upon you, 
  and that I have preferred you over all the worlds. 
  
  123. And beware of a day when no soul can avail another soul, nor will any amendment 
  be accepted from it, nor will any intercession help it; they will not be supported. 
  
  
  124. And Abraham was tested by commands from His Lord, which he completed. He 
  said: I will make you a role model for the people He replied: And 
  from my progeny? He said: My pledge will not encompass the wicked.
  
  125. And We have made the House an example for the people and a sanctuary. And 
  take comfort from the station of Abraham. And We entrusted to Abraham and Ishmael: 
  You shall purify My House for those who visit, those who are devoted, 
  and for those who yield and submit. 
  
  126. And Abraham said: My Lord, make this town a sanctuary, and provide 
  for its inhabitants of the fruits for whoever believes in God and the last day. 
  He said: As for he who rejects, I will let him enjoy for a while, then 
  I will force him to the retribution of the Fire, what a miserable destiny! 
  
  
  127. And Abraham raised the pillars of the House with Ishmael: Our Lord 
  accept this from us, You are the Hearer, the Knowledgeable.
  
  128. Our Lord, and make us compliant to You and from our progeny a compliant 
  nation to You, and show us our rites and forgive us; You are the most Forgiving, 
  Most Merciful.
  
  129. Our Lord, and send amongst them a messenger from among themselves, 
  that he may recite to them Your revelations and teach them the scripture and 
  the wisdom, and purify them. You are the Noble, the Wise.
  
  130. And who would abandon the creed of Abraham except one who fools himself? 
  We have selected him in this world, and in the Hereafter he is of the righteous. 
  
  
  131. When his Lord said to him: Comply, he said: I comply 
  to the Lord of the worlds.
  
  132. And Abraham enjoined his sons and Jacob: O my sons, God Has selected 
  the system for you, so do not die except in compliance.
  
  133. Or were you present when death came to Jacob and he told his sons: Who 
  shall you serve after I am gone?, they said: Your God, and the God 
  of your fathers Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac; One God and to Him we are compliant 
  
  
  134. That was a nation that has passed away; to them is what they have earned, 
  and to you is what you have earned; and you will not be asked regarding what 
  they did. 
  
  135. And they said: Be Jews or Nazarenes so that you may be guided! 
  Say: No, rather the creed of Abraham, monotheism; for he was not one of 
  those who set-up partners. 
  
  136. Say: We believe in God and in what was sent down to us and what was 
  sent down to Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the Patriarchs, 
  and what was given to Moses and Jesus, and what was given to the prophets from 
  their Lord; we do not make a distinction between any of them and to Him we are 
  compliant. 
  
  137. So, if they believe exactly as you have believed, then they are guided; 
  and if they turn away, then they are in opposition and God will suffice you 
  against them, and He is the Hearer, the Knower. 
  
  138. Such is God's coloring, and who better than God in coloring. And to Him 
  we are in service. 
  
  139. Say: Do you debate with us in God while He is our Lord and your Lord, 
  and we have our work and you have your work, and to Him we are believers. 
  
  
  140. Or do you say that Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the 
  Patriarchs were all Jewish or Nazarene? Say: Are you more knowledgeable 
  or is God? Who is more wicked than one who conceals a testimony with him 
  from God? God is not unaware of what you do. 
  
  141. That was a nation that passed away, to them is what they earned and to 
  you is what you have earned; you will not be asked about what they did. 
  
  142. The foolish from amongst the people will say: What has turned them 
  away from the focal point that they were on? Say: To God is the 
  east and the west, He guides whomsoever He wishes to a straight path. 
  
  
  143. And as such, We have made you a balanced nation so that you may be witness 
  over the people, and that the messenger may be witness over you. And We did 
  not make the focal point that you were on except to know who follows the messenger 
  from those who will turn on their heels. It was a great thing indeed except 
  for those whom God had guided; God was not to waste your belief. God is Merciful 
  and Compassionate over the people. 
  
  144. We see the shifting of your face towards the sky, We will thus set for 
  you a focal point that will be pleasing to you: you shall set your face 
  towards the restricting temple; and wherever you may be, you shall all set your 
  faces towards it. Those who have been given the scripture know it is the 
  truth from their Lord. And God is not unaware of what you do. 
  
  145. And if you come to those who have been given the scripture with every sign 
  they will not follow your focal point, nor will you follow their focal point, 
  nor will some of them even follow the others focal point. And if you were to 
  follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you, then you would 
  be one of the wicked. 
  
  146. Those to whom We have given the scripture know it as they know their own 
  children; and a group of them hides the truth while they know. 
  
  147. The truth is from your Lord, so do not be one of those who doubt. 
  
  148. And to each is a direction that he will take, so you shall race towards 
  good deeds. Wherever you may be, God will bring you all together. God is capable 
  of all things. 
  
  149. And from wherever you go out, you shall set your face towards the restricting 
  temple; it is the truth from your Lord; and God is not unaware of what you do. 
  
  
  150. And wherever you go out, you shall set your face towards the restricting 
  temple. And wherever you may be you shall set your faces towards it; that the 
  people will have no room for debate with you, except those of them who are wicked. 
  You shall not fear them, but fear Me; so that I may complete My blessings upon 
  you and that you may be guided. 
  
  151. As We have sent a messenger to you from amongst yourselves to recite Our 
  revelations to you, and purify you, and teach you the scripture and the wisdom, 
  and teach you what you did not know. 
  
  152. So remember Me that I may remember you, and be thankful to Me and do not 
  disbelieve. 
  
  153. O you who believe, seek help through patience and the salat, God is with 
  the patient ones. 
  
  154. And do not say of those who are killed in the sake of God that they are 
  dead; no, they are alive but you do not perceive. 
  
  155. And We will test you with some fear and hunger, and a shortage in money 
  and lives and fruits. And give good news to those who are patient. 
  
  156. The ones who, when afflicted with adversity, they say: We are to 
  God and to Him we will return. 
  
  157. To these will be commitments from their Lord and a mercy, they are the 
  guided ones. 
  
  158. The Safa and Marwah are amongst the rites of God. Whomsoever travels to 
  the House for the Pilgrimage or merely visits, commits no error that he should 
  briefly visit them. And whoever does good voluntarily, then God is Appreciative, 
  Knowledgeable. 
  
  159. Surely those who conceal what We have sent down to them which was clear, 
  and the guidance, after God Had made it clear in the scripture; these will be 
  cursed by God and be cursed by those who curse. 
  
  160. Except those who repent and amend and make clear; for those I will accept 
  their repentance, for I am the One who accepts repentance, the Most Merciful. 
  
  
  161. Surely, those who have disbelieved and then died as disbelievers; they 
  will be cursed by God, and the Angels, and all the people. 
  
  162. They will abide therein forever, and the retribution will not be lightened 
  for them, nor will they be reprieved. 
  
  163. And your God is but One God, there is no God but He; the Almighty the Most 
  Merciful. 
  
  164. Surely, in the creation of heavens and earth, and the differences between 
  night and day, and the ship that sails in the sea for the benefit of the people, 
  and what God has sent down of water from the sky so He brings the earth back 
  to life after it had died, and He sent forth from it every creature, and the 
  movement of the winds and the clouds that have been designated between the earth 
  and the sky are signs for a people that understand. 
  
  165. And from among the people are some who take other than God as His equals, 
  they love them as they love God; but those who believe love God more strongly; 
  and when those who were wicked see the retribution, they will see that all power 
  belongs to God, and that God is severe in retribution. 
  
  166. When those who were followed will disown those who followed them, and they 
  will see the retribution, and all excuses have abandoned them. 
  
  167. And those who followed them said: If we could have a chance to disown 
  them as they have disowned us It is such that God will show them their 
  work which is regretted for them; they will not leave the Fire. 
  
  168. O people, eat of what is in the earth as good and lawful, and do not follow 
  the steps of the devil, he is to you a clear enemy. 
  
  169. He only orders you to evil and sin, and that you may say about God what 
  you do not know. 
  
  170. And if they are told: Follow what God has sent down, they say: 
  No, we will follow what we found our fathers doing What if their 
  fathers did not understand anything and were not guided? 
  
  171. And the example of those who disbelieve is like one who repeats what he 
  has heard of calls and shouts; deaf, dumb, and blind, they do not understand. 
  
  
  172. O you who believe, eat of the good things We have provided for you, and 
  be thankful to God; if it is Him you serve. 
  
  173. He Has only forbidden for you what is already dead, and blood, and the 
  meat of pig, and what was dedicated to other than God. Whoever finds himself 
  forced out of need without disobedience or animosity, then there is no sin upon 
  him. God is Forgiving, Merciful. 
  
  174. Surely, those who conceal what God Has sent down of the scripture, and 
  they purchase with it a cheap price; they will not eat in their stomachs except 
  the Fire, and God will not speak to them on the day of resurrection, nor will 
  He purify them, and they will have a painful retribution. 
  
  175. These are the ones who have purchased straying for guidance, and retribution 
  for forgiveness; they have no patience towards the Fire. 
  
  176. This is because God Has sent down the scripture with truth; and those who 
  have disputed in the scripture are in far opposition. 
  
  177. Piety is not to turn your faces towards the east and the west, but piety 
  is one who believes in God and the last day, and the Angels, and the scripture, 
  and the prophets, and he gives money out of love to the near relatives, and 
  the orphans, and the needy and the wayfarer, and those who ask, and to free 
  the slaves, and he upholds the salat, and he contributes to the zakat; and those 
  who keep their pledges when they make a pledge, and those who are patient in 
  the face of good and bad and when in despair. These are the ones who have been 
  truthful, and they are the righteous. 
  
  178. O you who believe, execution has been decreed for you in the case of murder; 
  the free for the free, and the slave for the slave, and the female for the female. 
  Whoever is forgiven anything by his brother, then it is to be followed with 
  good deeds and kindness towards him; that is alleviation from your Lord, and 
  a mercy. Whoever transgresses after that, he will have a painful retribution. 
  
  
  179. And through execution, you will be giving life, O people of understanding, 
  that you may be righteous. 
  
  180. It is decreed for you that if death should come to any of you, that it 
  is best if he leaves a will for his family and relatives out of goodness; this 
  is a truth for the righteous. 
  
  181. Whoever alters it after having heard, then the sin will be upon those who 
  alter it. God is Hearer, Knowing. 
  
  182. If anyone fears harm or sin from his beneficiary, then reconcile what is 
  between them. God is Forgiving, Merciful. 
  
  183. O you who believe, it is decreed for you to fast as it was decreed for 
  those before you that you may be righteous. 
  
  184. For a limited number of days. Whoever of you is ill or traveling, then 
  the same number from different days; and as for those who can do so but with 
  difficulty, they may redeem by feeding the needy. And whoever does good voluntarily, 
  then it is better for him. And if you fast it is better for you if you knew. 
  
  
  185. The hottest month, in which the Quran was sent down as a guide and clarification 
  of the guidance and the criterion. Whoever witnesses the month, then let him 
  fast in it. And for whoever is ill or traveling, then the equivalent number 
  from different days. God wants to bring you ease and not to bring you hardship; 
  and you shall complete the count, and glorify God for what He Has guided you, 
  that you may be thankful. 
  
  186. And if My servants ask you about Me, I am near answering the calls of those 
  who call to Me. So let them respond to Me and believe in Me that they may be 
  guided. 
  
  187. It has been made lawful for you during the night of fasting to approach 
  your women sexually. They are a garment for you and you are a garment for them. 
  God knows that you used to betray your souls so He Has accepted your repentance, 
  and forgiven you; now you may approach them and seek what God Has written for 
  you. And you may eat and drink until the white thread is distinct from the black 
  thread of dawn; then you shall complete the fast until night; and do not approach 
  them while you are on duty in the temples. These are God's boundaries, so do 
  not transgress them. It is thus that God makes His revelations clear to the 
  people that they may be righteous. 
  
  188. And do not consume your money between you unjustly by bribing the decision 
  makers so that you may consume a part of the other people's money sinfully while 
  you know! 
  
  189. They ask you regarding the crescents, say: They are a timing device 
  for the people and for the Pilgrimage And piety is not that you would 
  enter a home through its back, but piety is whomever is righteous and come to 
  the homes from their main doors. And be aware of God that you may succeed. 
  
  190. And fight in the cause of God against those who fight you, but do not transgress, 
  God does not love the aggressors. 
  
  191. And kill them wherever you find them, and expel them from where they expelled 
  you, and know that persecution is worse than being killed. And do not fight 
  them at the restricting temple unless they fight you in it; if they fight you 
  then kill them, thus is the reward of the disbelievers. 
  
  192. And if they cease, then God is Forgiving, Merciful. 
  
  193. And fight them so there is no more persecution, and so that the system 
  is God's. If they cease, then there will be no aggression except against the 
  wicked. 
  
  194. What is done in the month of restriction may be met with equal force, and 
  if what is done is forbidden, it will be punishable by execution. Whoever attacks 
  you, then you shall attack him the same as he attacked you; and be aware of 
  God, and know that God is with the righteous.
  
  195. And spend in the cause of God, but do not throw your resources to disaster. 
  And do kindness, for God loves those who do kindness. 
  
  196. And complete the Pilgrimage and the visit for God; if you cannot, then 
  make what is easy of the animal sacrifice, and do not shave your heads until 
  the animal sacrifice reaches its destination. Whoever of you is ill or has an 
  affliction on his head, then you may redeem by fasting or giving a charity or 
  a sacrifice. If you are secure, then whoever continues the visit until the Pilgrimage, 
  then he shall provide what he can of the animal sacrifice. As for he who cannot 
  find anything, then he must fast for three days during the Pilgrimage and seven 
  when he returns; this will make a complete ten; this is for those whose family 
  do not live near the restricting temple. And be aware of God, and know that 
  God is severe in retribution. 
  
  197. The Pilgrimage is during the leap months. If anyone declares the Pilgrimage 
  in them, then there shall be no sexual approach, nor vileness, nor argument 
  in the Pilgrimage. And any good that you do, God is aware of it; and bring provisions 
  for yourselves, though the best provision is righteousness; and be aware of 
  Me O people of understanding. 
  
  198. There is no sin upon you to seek goodness from your Lord. So when you finish 
  from Ara'fat, then remember God at the location of restriction, and remember 
  Him as He has guided you, for you were before that straying. 
  
  199. Then you shall disperse from where the people dispersed, and seek God's 
  forgiveness; God is surely Forgiving, Most Merciful. 
  
  200. When you have completed your rites, then remember God as you remember your 
  fathers or even greater. From among the people are those who say: Our 
  Lord, give us from this world!, but in the Hereafter he has no part. 
  
  201. And some of them say: Our Lord, give us good in this world, and good 
  in the Hereafter, and spare us from the retribution of the Fire. 
  
  202. These will have a portion of what they have gained; and God is quick in 
  judgment. 
  
  203. And remember God during the limited number of days. Whoever hurries to 
  two days, there is no sin upon him; and whoever delays, there is no sin upon 
  him if he is being righteous. And be aware of God, and know that it is to Him 
  that you will be gathered. 
  
  204. And from among the people are those whose words you admire about this worldly 
  life, but God is witness as to what is in his heart, for he is the worst in 
  opposition. 
  
  205. And if he gains power, he seeks to corrupt the earth and destroy its crops, 
  and people's lineage. God does not like corruption. 
  
  206. And if he is told: Be aware of God, his pride leads to more 
  sin. Hell will be enough for him; what a miserable abode! 
  
  207. And from among the people is he who develops his soul by seeking God's 
  favour; God is kind to His servants. 
  
  208. O you who believe, join in peace, all of you, and do not follow the footsteps 
  of the devil. He is to you a clear enemy. 
  
  209. But if you slip after the clarity has come to you, then know that God is 
  Noble, Wise. 
  
  210. Are they waiting for God to come to them shadowed in clouds with the Angels? 
  The matter would then be finished! And to God all matters will return. 
  
  211. Ask the Children of Israel how many clear signs did We give them? And whoever 
  changes God's favour after it has come to him, then God is Mighty in retribution. 
  
  
  212. This worldly life has been made pleasing to the disbelievers, and they 
  mock those who believe. And those who are righteous will be above them on the 
  day of resurrection; God provides for whoever He wishes without a price. 
  
  213. The people used to be one nation, then God sent the prophets as bearers 
  of good news and warners, and He sent down with them the scripture with the 
  facts so that they may judge between the people in what they were disputing. 
  But after receiving the clarity, the people disputed in it due to animosity 
  between them. And God guided those who believed with His permission regarding 
  what they disputed in of the truth. And God guides whoever He wishes to a straight 
  path. 
  
  214. Or did you expect that you would enter Paradise, while the example of those 
  who were before you came to you: they were stricken with adversity and hardship, 
  and they were shaken until the messenger and those who believed with him said: 
  When is God's victory? Yes indeed, God's victory is near. 
  
  215. They ask you what they should spend, say: What you spend out of goodness 
  should go to your family and the relatives and the orphans, and the needy, and 
  the traveller. And any good you do, God is fully aware of it. 
  
  216. Warfare has been decreed for you while you hate it; and perhaps you may 
  hate something while it is good for you, and perhaps you may love something 
  while it is bad for you; God knows while you do not know. 
  
  217. They ask you about the month of restriction: Is there fighting in 
  it? Say: Much fighting is in it, and to repel from the path of God 
  and to disbelieve in it and the restricting temple, and to drive its inhabitants 
  out of it is far greater with God, and persecution is worse than being killed. 
  And they still will fight you until they turn you back from your system if they 
  are able. And whoever of you turns back from his system, and he dies while disbelieving, 
  then these have nullified their work in this life and the next; these are the 
  people of the Fire, in it they will abide eternally!
  
  218. Those who believe, and those who have immigrated and strived in the cause 
  of God; these are seeking God's mercy, and God is Forgiving, Merciful. 
  
  219. They ask you about intoxicants and gambling. Say: In them is great 
  harm, and a benefit for the people; but their harm is greater than their benefit 
  And they ask you how much are they to spend, say: The excess It 
  is thus that God clarifies for you the revelations that you may think. 
  
  220. In this world and the next; and they ask you regarding the orphans, say: 
  To fix their situation is best, and if you are to care for them, then 
  they are your brothers. And God knows the corrupt from the good, and had God 
  wished He could have made things difficult. God is Noble, Wise. 
  
  221. And do not marry the females who set-up partners until they believe. For 
  a believing servant is better than one who sets-up partners even if she attracts 
  you. And do not marry the males who set-up partners until they believe. For 
  a believing servant is better than one who sets up partners even if he attracts 
  you. Those invite to the Fire, while God is inviting to Paradise and forgiveness 
  by His leave. He clarifies His revelations for the people that they may remember. 
  
  
  222. And they ask you about menstruation? Say: It is harmful, so retire 
  yourselves sexually from the women during the menstruation, and do not approach 
  them until they are cleansed. When they are cleansed, then you may approach 
  them as God has commanded you. God loves the repenters and He loves the 
  cleansed. 
  
  223. Your women are a cultivation for you. So approach your cultivation as you 
  may will but act for your own good. And be aware of God and know that you will 
  meet Him, and give good news to the believers.
  
  224. And do not make God the subject of your casual swearing. Be pious and righteous 
  and reconcile among the people; and God is Listener, Knower. 
  
  225. God will not call you to account for your casual swearing, but He will 
  call you to account for what has entered your hearts. God is Forgiving, Compassionate. 
  
  
  226. For those who wish to divorce their wives, then they must wait four months. 
  If they retract, then God is Forgiving, Most Merciful. 
  
  227. And if they insist on divorce, then God is Hearer, Knowledgeable. 
  
  228. And the divorced women shall hold themselves for three menstruation periods; 
  and it is not lawful for them to conceal what God has created in their wombs, 
  if they believe in God and the last day. And their husbands would still have 
  a right to return them in this situation if they both wish to reconcile. And 
  for what obligations the women are owed, so similarly must they fulfil their 
  obligations. But the men will have a greater responsibility over them in this. 
  And God is Noble, Wise. 
  
  229. Divorce may be done twice, then either they remain together equitably, 
  or they separate with kindness. And it is not lawful for you to take back anything 
  you have given the women unless you fear that they will not uphold God's limits. 
  So if you fear that they will not uphold God's limits, then there is no sin 
  upon them for what is given back. These are God's limits so do not transgress 
  them. And whoever shall transgress God's limits, then these are the wicked. 
  
  
  230. So if he then divorces her after that, she will not be lawful for him until 
  she marries another husband. If the other husband then divorces her, then there 
  is no sin that they come back together if they think they will uphold God's 
  limits. These are God's limits, He clarifies them for a people that know. 
  
  231. And if you divorce the women, and they reach their required interim, then 
  you shall either reconcile with them equitably, or separate from them equitably. 
  And do not reconcile with them so you can harm them out of animosity; whoever 
  does so does wickedness to his soul. And do not take God's revelations lightly. 
  And remember God's blessings towards you, and what was sent down to you of the 
  scripture and the wisdom, He warns you with it. And be aware of God and know 
  that God is Knowledgeable in all things. 
  
  232. And if you divorce the women, and they complete their interim period, then 
  do not prevent them from remarrying their husbands if they amicably agree amongst 
  themselves out of what is best. This is to remind any of you who believe in 
  God and the last day, this is better for you and purer; and God knows while 
  you do not know. 
  
  233. And the divorced mothers are allowed to suckle their children two full 
  years, if they wish to complete the suckling cycle. And the man for whom the 
  child is born is responsible for both their provisions and clothing equitably. 
  We do not burden a soul beyond its means. No mother shall be harmed because 
  of her child, nor shall a father be harmed because of his child. And for the 
  guardian is the same requirement. So if they wish to separate out of mutual 
  agreement and council, then there is no sin upon them. And if you want to hire 
  nursing mothers, then there is no sin upon you if you give back what you have 
  been given equitably. And be aware of God, and know that God is watching over 
  what you do. 
  
  234. And for those of you who die and leave widows behind, then their widows 
  must wait for four months and ten days. So when they reach their required interim, 
  then there is no sin upon you for what they do to themselves equitably. And 
  God is Expert to what you do. 
  
  235. And there is no sin upon you if you openly propose marriage to these women, 
  or you keep it between yourselves. God knows that you will be thinking of them, 
  but do not date them secretly except to say what is good. And do not commit 
  to the marriage vows until the required interim is reached in the scripture. 
  And know that God knows what is in your souls, so be aware of Him, and know 
  that God is Forgiving, Compassionate. 
  
  236. There is no sin upon you if you divorce the women before having sexual 
  intercourse with them, or before agreeing to the dowry for them. Let them enjoy, 
  the rich according to his means, and the poor according to his means. Enjoyment 
  in good deeds, a responsibility for those in kindness. 
  
  237. And if you divorce them before having sexual intercourse with them, but 
  you have already agreed to the dowry; then you must give half of what you have 
  agreed, unless they forgive or the guardian over the marriage contract forgives. 
  And if you forgive, it is closer to righteousness. And do not forget the favour 
  between you; God is Seer over what you do. 
  
  238. Preserve the salawat, and the balanced salat, and stand devoutly for God. 
  
  
  239. But if you are in a state of fear, then you may do so while walking or 
  riding. If you become secure, then remember God as He Has taught you what you 
  did not know. 
  
  240. And those of you who die and leave widows behind; a testimony to them that 
  they may enjoy for one year without being made to vacate. If they leave then 
  there is no sin upon you for what they did to themselves in goodness; and God 
  is Noble, Wise. 
  
  241. And for the divorced women to enjoy equitably is an obligation upon the 
  righteous. 
  
  242. It is such that God clarifies to you His revelations that you may comprehend. 
  
  
  243. Did you not see those who left their homes in groups and they were weary 
  of death; God said to them: Die, then He resurrected them. God Has 
  great favour over the people, but most people are not thankful. 
  
  244. And fight in the cause of God and know that God is the Hearer, the Knowledgeable. 
  
  
  245. Who will lend God a loan of goodness that He may multiply it for him many 
  times over? God collects and He distributes, and to Him you will return. 
  
  246. Did you not see to the leaders of the Children of Israel after Moses, they 
  said to their prophet: Send us a king that we may fight in the cause of 
  God; he said: Are you not concerned that if fighting is decreed 
  upon you, you will then not fight? They said: And why should we 
  not fight in the cause of God when we have been driven out from our homes with 
  our children So it was, that when fighting was decreed for them they turned 
  away, except for a few of them! God is fully aware of the wicked. 
  
  247. And their prophet said to them: God Has sent Saul to you as a king 
  They said: How can he have the kingship when we are more deserving than 
  him, and he has not been given an abundance of wealth? He said: God 
  has chosen him over you and increased him in knowledge and stature God 
  gives His kingship to whom He chooses; and God is Encompassing, Knowledgeable. 
  
  
  248. And their prophet said to them: The sign of his kingship shall be 
  that he brings to you the Tomb in which there is a tranquility from your Lord 
  and the remainder of what was left behind by the people of Moses and the people 
  of Aaron being carried by the Angels. In this is a sign for you if you are believers. 
  
  
  249. So when Saul set out with the soldiers, he said: God will test you 
  with a river, whoever drinks from it is not with me, and whoever does not taste 
  it is with me, except he who takes one scoop with his hand They all drank 
  from it, except a few of them. So when he and those who believed with him crossed 
  it, they said: We have no power today against Goliath and his soldiers! 
  But the ones who understood that they would meet God said: How many a 
  time has a small group beaten a large group by God's leave, and God is with 
  the patient ones! 
  
  250. And when they came forth to Goliath and his soldiers, they said: Our 
  Lord grant us patience, and make firm our foothold, and grant us victory over 
  the disbelieving people. 
  
  251. So they beat them by God's leave, and David killed Goliath, and God gave 
  him the kingship and the wisdom and taught him what he wished. And had it not 
  been for God pushing the people to challenge one another, then the earth would 
  have already been corrupted. But God has done favour over the worlds. 
  
  252. These are God's revelations, We recite them to you with truth, and you 
  are of the messengers. 
  
  253. Those messengers, We have preferred some over others; some of them talked 
  to God, and He raised some of them in rank, and We gave Jesus the son of Mary 
  the proofs and We supported him with the holy spirit. And had God wished, the 
  people after them would not have fought after the proofs had come to them, but 
  they disputed, some of them believed and some of them disbelieved. Had God wished 
  they would not have fought, but God does whatever He wishes. 
  
  254. O you who believe, spend from what We have provided for you before a day 
  will come when there is no trade, nor friendship, nor intercession; and the 
  disbelievers are the wicked. 
  
  255. God, there is no god but He, the Living, the Sustainer. No slumber or sleep 
  overtakes Him; to Him belongs all that is in heavens and in earth. Who will 
  intercede with Him except by His leave. He knows their present and their future, 
  and they do not have any of His knowledge except for what He wishes. His throne 
  encompasses all of heavens of earth and is easy for Him to preserve them. He 
  is the High, the Great. 
  
  256. There is no compulsion in this system, the proper way has been made clear 
  from the wrong way. Whoever rejects evil, and believes in God, then he has grasped 
  the most solid branch that will never break. God is Hearer, Knower. 
  
  257. God is the ally of those who believe, He brings them out of the darkness 
  and into the light. As for those who reject, their allies are evil, they bring 
  them out of the light and into the darkness; these are the people of the Fire, 
  in it they will abide eternally. 
  
  258. Did the news come to you of the person who debated with Abraham regarding 
  his Lord, because God had given him a kingship? Abraham said: My Lord 
  is the One who gives life and death, he said: I bring life and death 
  Abraham said: God brings the sun from the east, so you bring it from the 
  west The one who disbelieved was confounded; and God does not guide the 
  wicked people. 
  
  259. Or the one who passed through a town, where all its inhabitants had passed 
  away. He said: How can God possibly resurrect this after its death? 
  So God put him to death for one hundred lunar years, then He resurrected him. 
  He said: How long have you stayed here? He said: I have stayed 
  here a day or part of a day He said: No, you have stayed here for 
  one hundred lunar years! Look at your food and drink, they have not changed, 
  but look at your mule And We will make you a sign for the people, and 
  look at the bones how We grow them, then We cover them with meat So when 
  it was clear to him what happened, he said: I now know that God is capable 
  over all things! 
  
  260. And Abraham said: My Lord, show me how you resurrect the dead. 
  He said: Do you not already believe? He said: I do, but it 
  is so my heart can be relieved He said: Choose four birds, then 
  cut them, then place parts of the birds on each mountain, then call them to 
  you; they will come racing towards you And know that God is Noble, Wise. 
  
  
  261. The example of those who spend their money in the cause of God is like 
  a seed that sprouts forth seven pods, in each pod there is one hundred seeds; 
  and God multiplies for whoever He chooses, and God is Encompassing, Knowledgeable. 
  
  
  262. Those who spend their money in the cause of God, then they do not follow 
  what they have spent with insult nor harm; they will have their reward with 
  their Lord, there is no fear over them nor will they grieve. 
  
  263. Kind words and forgiveness is far better than a charity that is followed 
  by harm. God is Rich, Compassionate. 
  
  264. O you who believe, do not nullify your charities with insult and harm; 
  like the one who spends his money in vanity to show the people, and he does 
  not believe in God and the last day. His example is like a stone on which their 
  is dust, then it is subjected to heavy rain which leaves it bare. They cannot 
  do anything with what they earned; and God does not guide the rejecting people. 
  
  
  265. And the example of those who spend their money seeking God's grace, and 
  to save their souls, is like the example of a garden on a high ground which 
  is subjected to a heavy rain, and because of that it produces double its crop! 
  And if no heavy rain comes, then light rain is enough. And God is Seer over 
  all you do. 
  
  266. Does anyone of you desire that he have a garden with palm trees and grapevines, 
  and rivers flowing beneath it, and in it for him are all kinds of fruits, then 
  he is afflicted with old age and his progeny is weak, and a whirlwind with fire 
  strikes it and it all burns? It is thus that God makes clear for you the signs 
  that you may reflect. 
  
  267. O you who believe, spend from the good things that you have earned, and 
  from what We have brought forth from the earth. And do not choose the rotten 
  out of it to give, while you would not take it yourselves unless you close your 
  eyes regarding it. And know that God is Rich, Praiseworthy. 
  
  268. The devil promises you poverty and orders you to evil, while God promises 
  forgiveness from Him and favour. God is Encompassing, Knowledgeable. 
  
  269. He grants wisdom to whom He chooses, and whoever is granted wisdom, has 
  been given much good. Only those with understanding will remember. 
  
  270. And whatever you spend out of your monies, or whatever you pledge as a 
  promise, then God knows it. The wicked have no supporters. 
  
  271. If you openly give charity, then it is acceptable; but if you conceal it 
  and give it to the poor, then that is better for you. And He cancels some of 
  your sins; and God is Expert to all that you do. 
  
  272. You are not responsible for their guidance, but it is God who will guide 
  whoever He wishes. And whatever you spend out of goodness is for your own souls. 
  And anything you spend should be in seeking God's direction. And whatever you 
  spend out of goodness will be retuned to you, and you will not be wronged. 
  
  273. As for the poor who face hardship in the cause of God, and they cannot 
  travel in the land; the ignorant ones think they are rich from their modesty; 
  you know them by their features, they do not ask the people at all. And what 
  you spend out of goodness, God is fully aware of it. 
  
  274. Those who spend their money in the night and in the day, secretly and openly, 
  they will have their reward with their Lord, there is no fear over them nor 
  will they grieve. 
  
  275. Those who consume financial interest, they do not rise except as the one 
  who is being beaten by the devil out of direct touch. That is because they have 
  said: Trade is like financial interest While God Has made trade 
  lawful, and He has forbidden financial interest. Whoever has received understanding 
  from His Lord and ceases, then he will be forgiven for what was before this 
  and his case will be with God. But whoever returns, they are the people of the 
  Fire, in it they will abide eternally. 
  
  276. God wipes out financial interest and He grants growth to charities. And 
  God does not love every wicked sinner. 
  
  277. Those who believe and do good works, and uphold the salat, and contribute 
  to the zakat; they will have their rewards with their Lord and there is no fear 
  over them nor will they grieve. 
  
  278. O you who believe, be aware of God and give up what is left of the financial 
  interest if you are truly believers. 
  
  279. And if you will not do this, then take notice of a war from God and His 
  messenger; but if you repent, then you will have back your principal money, 
  you will not be wronged nor will you wrong. 
  
  280. If the person is facing insolvency, then you shall wait until he becomes 
  able. And if you relinquish it as a charity it is better for you if you knew. 
  
  
  281. And be aware of a day when you will be returned to God then every soul 
  will be paid what it has earned, they will not be wronged. 
  
  282. O you who believe, if you borrow debt for a future period, then you shall 
  record it. And let a scribe of justice record it for you; and let not the scribe 
  refuse to record as God Has taught him. Let him record and let the person who 
  is borrowing dictate to him, and let him be aware of God, and let him not reduce 
  from it anything. If the one who is borrowing is immature or weak or he cannot 
  dictate himself, then let his guardian dictate with justice. And bring two witnesses 
  from amongst your men, if they are not two men, then a man and two women from 
  whom you will accept their testimony, so that if one of them becomes misled, 
  then the one can remind the other. And let the witnesses not refuse to come 
  if they are called. And do not fail to record it no matter how small or large 
  until its maturity. That is more just with God and better for the testimony, 
  and better that you do not have doubts; except if it is a trade to be done on 
  the spot between you, then their is no sin upon you if you do not record it. 
  And have witnesses if you trade. No scribe shall be harmed nor any witness; 
  for if you do so then it is vileness on your part, and be aware of God and God 
  teaches you and God is aware of all things. 
  
  283. And if you are traveling or do not find a scribe, then a pledge of collateral. 
  If you trust each other then let the one who was entrusted deliver his trust, 
  and let him be aware of God, and do not hold back the testimony. And whoever 
  holds it back, then he has sinned in his heart, and God is aware of what you 
  do. 
  
  284. To God is what is in the heavens and in earth, and if you declare what 
  is in your souls or hide it, God will call you to account for it. He will forgive 
  whom He wishes, and punish whom He wishes, and God is capable of all things. 
  
  
  285. The messenger believes in what was sent down to him from his Lord. And 
  the believers, all who believe in God, and His angles, and His scriptures, and 
  His messengers; we do not differentiate between any of His messengers; and they 
  said: We hear and obey, forgive us O Lord, and to you is our destiny. 
  
  
  286. God does not burden a soul beyond its means. For it is what it earns, and 
  against it is what it earns. Our Lord, do not mind us if we forget or 
  make mistakes; our Lord, do not place upon us a burden as you have placed upon 
  those before us; our Lord, do not place upon us what we cannot bare; pardon 
  us, and forgive us, and have mercy on us; you are our patron, grant us victory 
  over the disbelieving people.
