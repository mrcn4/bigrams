 Chapter 3

In the name of God, the Almighty, the Most Merciful
 
1. A.L.M. 
  
  2. God, there is no god but He, the Living, the Sustainer. 
  
  3. He sent down to you the scripture with truth, authenticating what is already 
  present with him; and He sent down the Torah and the Injeel. 
  
  4. From before as a guidance for the people, and He sent down the Criterion. 
  Those who rejected God's revelations, they will have a painful retribution, 
  and God is Noble, able to Revenge. 
  
  5. To God nothing is hidden in the earth or in the heavens. 
  
  6. He is the One who pictures you in the wombs as He pleases. There is no god 
  but Him, the Noble, the Wise. 
  
  7. He is the One who sent down to you the scripture, from which there are law 
  giving verses; they are the essence of the scripture; and others which are similar 
  to each other. As for those who have disease in their hearts, they will follow 
  what is similar of it seeking to confuse, and seeking to derive an interpretation. 
  But none know its interpretation except God and those who are well founded in 
  knowledge. They say: We believe in it, all is from our Lord And 
  none will remember except the people of understanding. 
  
  8. Our Lord, do not make our hearts deviate after You have guided us, 
  and grant us from You a mercy; You are the Grantor. 
  
  9. Our Lord, You will gather the people for a day in which there is no 
  doubt; God does not break His appointment. 
  
  10. As for those who rejected, neither their money nor their children will avail 
  them anything from God. They are the fuel for the Fire. 
  
  11. Like the behaviour of the people of Pharaoh and those before them. They 
  rejected Our signs so God took them for their sins. God is awesome in retribution. 
  
  
  12. Say to those who have rejected: You will be defeated and gathered 
  towards Hell, what a miserable abode! 
  
  13. There was a sign for you in the two groups that met. One was fighting in 
  the cause of God, and the other was rejecting. They saw them as twice their 
  number with their eyes. And God supports with His victory whom He wills. In 
  this is a lesson for those with vision. 
  
  14. It has been adorned for people to love the desire of the most modern things, 
  and buildings, and ornaments made from gold and silver, and trained horses, 
  and the livestock, and fields; they are the enjoyment of the world, and with 
  God are the best goods.
  
  15. Say: Shall I inform you of what is greater than all this? For those 
  who believe in their Lord are gardens with rivers flowing beneath, in it they 
  abide eternally, and pure mates, and an acceptance from God. And God is watcher 
  over the servants. 
  
  16. The ones who say: Our Lord, we believe, so forgive us our sins, and 
  spare us the retribution of the Fire. 
  
  17. The patient, and the truthful, and the devout, and the spenders, and the 
  seekers of forgiveness in the last hours of the night. 
  
  18. God bears witness that there is no god but He, as do the Angels, and those 
  with knowledge, He is standing with evenness. There is no god but He, the Noble, 
  the Wise. 
  
  19. The system with God is Islam, and those who received the scripture did not 
  dispute except after the knowledge came to them out of jealousy between them. 
  And whoever rejects God's signs, then God is swift in judgment. 
  
  20. If they debate with you, then say: I have complied myself to God, 
  as well as those who follow me And say to those who have received the 
  scripture and the gentiles: Have you complied? If they comply then 
  they are guided, and if they turn away, then you are only to deliver, and God 
  is watcher over the servants. 
  
  21. Those who reject God's revelations and kill the prophets without truth, 
  and kill those who order justice from amongst the people; inform them of a painful 
  retribution. 
  
  22. These are the ones whose works will be lost in this world, and in the Hereafter 
  they will have no supporters. 
  
  23. Did you not see those who were given a portion of the scripture being invited 
  to God's scripture to judge between them, then a group of them turns away while 
  they are adverse? 
  
  24. That is because they said: The Fire will not touch us except a number 
  of days, and they were arrogant by what they invented in their system. 
  
  
  25. How shall it be when We gather them on the day in which there is no doubt; 
  and every soul shall receive what it has earned, and they will not be wronged. 
  
  
  26. Say: O God, Possessor of kingship; you grant kingship to whom You 
  please, and revoke kingship from whom You please, and honour whom You please, 
  and humiliate whom You please; in Your hand is goodness. You are capable of 
  all things. 
  
  27. You blend the night into the day, and blend the day into the night; 
  and you bring the living out of the dead, and bring the dead out of the living; 
  and You provide for whom You wish with no reckoning. 
  
  28. Let not the believers take the rejecters as allies instead of the believers. 
  And whoever does so will have nothing with God, except if you are cautious of 
  them as they deserve. And God warns you of Himself, and to God is the destiny. 
  
  
  29. Say: If you hide what is in your chests or you reveal it, God will 
  know And He knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth; and 
  God is capable of all things. 
  
  30. The day every soul will find what good it had done present, and what bad 
  it had done; it wishes that between them was a great distance. And God warns 
  you of Himself, and God is Compassionate with the servants. 
  
  31. Say: If you love God then follow me so God will love you and forgive 
  your sins God is Forgiver, Merciful. 
  
  32. Say: Obey God and the messenger But if they turn away, then 
  God does not like the rejecters. 
  
  33. God Has selected Adam, and Noah, and the family of Abraham, and the family 
  of Imran over the worlds. 
  
  34. A progeny each from the other, and God is Hearer, Knower. 
  
  35. Thus the wife of Imran said: My Lord, I have vowed to You what is 
  in my belly, dedicated, so accept from me, You are the Hearer, the Knower. 
  
  36. So when she delivered it she said: My Lord, I have delivered a female, 
  and God is fully aware of what she delivered, And the male is not like 
  the female, and I have named her Mary, and I seek refuge for her and her progeny 
  with You from the outcast devil. 
  
  37. So her Lord accepted a good acceptance, and made her grow into a good growth, 
  and charged Zachariah with her. Every time Zachariah entered on her in the Temple 
  enclosure, he found provisions with her. He said: O Mary, from where did 
  you get this? She said: It is from God, God provides for whom He 
  wishes without reckoning. 
  
  38. It was then that Zachariah called on his Lord, he said: My Lord, grant 
  me from You a good progeny, You are hearer of the prayers. 
  
  39. The Angels called to him while he was standing to his commitment in the 
  Temple enclosure: God gives you good tidings of John, authenticating the 
  word from God, and a master, and steadfast, and a prophet from the upright. 
  
  
  40. He said: My Lord, how can I have a son when old age has reached me 
  and my wife is sterile? He said: It is as such that God does what 
  He pleases. 
  
  41. He said: My Lord, make for me a sign He said: Your sign 
  is not to speak to the people for three days except by symbol, and remember 
  your lord greatly, and glorify at dusk and dawn. 
  
  42. And the Angels said: O Mary, God Has selected you and cleansed you, 
  and He has selected you over the women of the world. 
  
  43. O Mary, be devoted to your Lord and submit and yield with those who 
  yield. 
  
  44. This is from the news of the unseen that We inspire to you. You were not 
  with them when they drew straws as to which one of them will be charged with 
  Mary; you were not with them when they disputed. 
  
  45. And the Angels said: O Mary, God gives good news of a word from Him 
  whose name is the Messiah, Jesus the son of Mary. Honourable in this world and 
  in the Hereafter, and from among those who are made close. 
  
  46. And he speaks to the people from the cradle, and in old age, and from 
  among the upright. 
  
  47. She said: My lord, how can I have a son when no human has touched 
  me? He said: It is thus that God creates what He wills, when He 
  decrees a command, He merely says to it Be, and it is. 
  
  48. And He teaches him the scripture and the Wisdom and the Torah and the Injeel. 
  
  
  49. And a messenger to the Children of Israel: I have come to you with 
  a sign from your Lord; that I create for you from clay in the form of a bird, 
  then I blow into it and it becomes a bird by God's leave, and I heal the blind 
  and the leapers, and give life to the dead by God's leave, and I prophesise 
  for you what you shall eat and what to store in your homes. In that is a sign 
  for you if you are believers. 
  
  50. And authenticating what is present with me of the Torah, and to make 
  lawful some of that which was forbidden to you; and I have come to you with 
  a sign from your Lord, so be aware of God and obey me. 
  
  51. God is my Lord and your Lord, so serve Him, this is a Straight Path. 
  
  
  52. So when Jesus felt their rejection, he said: Who are my supporters 
  to God? The disciples said: We are God's supporters, we believe 
  in God and we bear witness that we are in compliance. 
  
  53. Our Lord, we believe in what You have sent down, and followed the 
  messenger, so record us with those who bear witness. 
  
  54. And they schemed and God schemed, but God is the best schemer. 
  
  55. God said: O Jesus, I will let you die, and raise you to Me, and cleanse 
  you of those who have rejected, and make those who have followed you above those 
  who rejected until the day of judgment; then to Me is your return so I will 
  judge between all of you in what it was that you disputed. 
  
  56. As for those who have rejected, I will punish them severely in this 
  world and in the Hereafter, they will have no supporters. 
  
  57. And as for those who believed and did good works, God will pay them 
  their reward; God does not like the wicked. 
  
  58. This We recite to you from the revelation and the Wise Reminder. 
  
  59. The example of Jesus with God is similar to that of Adam; He created him 
  from dust, then He said to him Be and he was. 
  
  60. The truth is from your Lord, so do not be of those who doubt. 
  
  61. Whoever debates with you in this after the knowledge has come to you, then 
  say: Let us call our children and your children, our women and your women, 
  our selves and yourselves, then, let us call out, and we shall make God's curse 
  upon the liars. 
  
  62. This is the narration of truth, there is no god but God; and God is the 
  Noble, the Wise. 
  
  63. And if they turn away, then God is aware of the corruptors. 
  
  64. Say: O people of the scripture, let us come to a common understanding 
  between us and between you; that we do not serve except God, and do not set-up 
  anything at all with Him, and that none of us takes each other as patrons beside 
  God If they turn away, then say: Bear witness that we are compliant. 
  
  
  65. O people of the scripture, why do you debate us regarding Abraham when the 
  Torah and the Injeel were not sent down except after him? Do you not understand? 
  
  
  66. Here you have debated in what you knew; so why then do you debate in what 
  you do not know? God knows while you do not know. 
  
  67. Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Nazarene, but he was a compliant monotheist; 
  he was not of those who set-up partners. 
  
  68. The most legitimate people for Abraham are those who followed him and this 
  prophet and those who believed; and God is the supporter of the believers. 
  
  69. A group from the people of the scripture wished that they could misguide 
  you, but they only misguide themselves and they do not notice. 
  
  70. O people of the scripture, why do you reject God's signs while you are bearing 
  witness? 
  
  71. O people of the scripture, why do you dress the truth with falsehood and 
  conceal the truth while you know? 
  
  72. And a group from among the people of the scripture said: Believe in 
  what was revealed to those who believed during the beginning of the day, and 
  reject it by the end of it, perhaps they will return. 
  
  73. And do not believe except to those who follow your system, say: 
  The guidance is God's guidance, that anyone should be given similar 
  to what you have been given, or that they debate with you at your Lord, say: 
  The bounty is in God's hand, He gives it to whom He chooses, and God is 
  Encompassing, Knowledgeable 
  
  74. He specifies with His mercy whom He chooses, and God is with the Great Bounty. 
  
  
  75. And from among the people of the scripture are those whom if you entrust 
  him with an ounce he gives it back to you, and there are those whom if you entrust 
  with a Dinar he will not return it to you unless you are standing over him. 
  That is because they said: We have no obligation towards the gentiles 
  They say about God lies while knowing. 
  
  76. Indeed, anyone who fulfils his pledge and is aware of God, then God loves 
  the righteous. 
  
  77. The ones that purchase with God's pledge and their oaths a small price, 
  those will have no portion in the Hereafter, and God will not speak to them 
  nor look at them on the day of resurrection nor purify them, and they will have 
  a painful retribution. 
  
  78. And from amongst them is a group that twist their tongues with the scripture 
  so that you may think it is from the scripture, while it is not from the scripture, 
  and they say it is from God while it is not from God, and they say about God 
  lies while they know. 
  
  79. It is not for a human that God would give him the scripture and the authority 
  and the prophethood, then he would say to the people: Be servants to me 
  rather than God!, but: be devotees for what you have been taught 
  of the scripture, and for what you studied. 
  
  80. Nor does he order you that you take the Angels and the prophets as patrons. 
  Would he order you to rejection after this, while you are compliant? 
  
  81. And God took a covenant from the prophets: For what I have given you 
  of the scripture and wisdom. Then a messenger will come to you authenticating 
  what is with you. You will believe in him and support him. He said: Do 
  you testify, and agree to this burden?, they said: We testify, 
  He said: Then bear witness, and I am with you bearing witness. 
  
  82. Whoever turns away after that, then they are the wicked ones. 
  
  83. Is it other than God's system that they desire, when those in the heavens 
  and the earth have complied to Him voluntarily or by force? And to Him they 
  will be returned. 
  
  84. Say: We believe in God and what was sent down to us and what was sent 
  down to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Patriarchs, and what 
  was given to Moses and Jesus and the prophets from their Lord, we do not make 
  any distinction between them, and to Him we are compliant
  
  85. And whoever follows other than Islam as a system, it will not be accepted 
  from him, and in the Hereafter he is of the losers. 
  
  86. How can God guide a people who have rejected after believing, and they witnessed 
  that the messenger is true, and the Clarity had come to them? God does not guide 
  the wicked people. 
  
  87. To these the punishment will be that God's curse will be upon them as well 
  as that of the Angels and the people all together! 
  
  88. Eternally they will abide in it, the retribution will not be lightened for 
  them, nor will they be reprieved. 
  
  89. Except those who repent after this and make amends, then God is Forgiver, 
  Merciful. 
  
  90. Those who have rejected after their belief then increased in rejection, 
  their repentance will not be accepted, they are the strayers. 
  
  91. Those who have rejected and died while they are rejecters, the earth full 
  of gold to be ransomed with will not be accepted from any of them. For these 
  there will be a painful retribution and they will have no supporters. 
  
  92. You will not reach piety until you spend from what you love; and whatever 
  you spend, God is aware of it. 
  
  93. All the food was made lawful to the Children of Israel except what Israel 
  forbade on himself before the Torah was sent down. Say: Bring the Torah 
  and recite it if you are truthful. 
  
  94. Whoever invents lies about God after that, these are the wicked. 
  
  95. Say: God bears truth. Follow the creed of Abraham, monotheism, and 
  he was not of those who set-up partners. 
  
  96. The first House established for the people is the one in Bakk'a, blessed, 
  and a guidance for the worlds. 
  
  97. In it are clear signs, the station of Abraham, and whoever enters it will 
  be secure. And God is owed from mankind the Pilgrimage to the House, whoever 
  can make a path to it. And whoever rejects, then God has no need of the worlds. 
  
  
  98. Say: O people of the scripture, why do you reject God's signs, while 
  God is witness over what you do? 
  
  99. Say: O people of the scripture, why do you repel from the path of 
  God those who believe? You wish to twist it while you were witness. And God 
  is not unaware of what you do. 
  
  100. O you who believe, if you obey a group of those who received the scripture 
  they will turn you after your belief into rejecters! 
  
  101. And how can you reject when God's revelations are being recited to you 
  and with you is His messenger? And whoever holds firmly to God has been guided 
  to the straight path. 
  
  102. O you who believe, revere God as He deserves to be revered, and do not 
  die except in compliance. 
  
  103. And hold firmly to the rope of God, all of you, and do not be separated. 
  And remember God's blessing upon you when you were enemies and He united your 
  hearts, and you became with His blessing as brothers; and you were on the verge 
  of a pit of fire and He saved you from it; it is thus that God clarifies for 
  you His signs that you may be guided. 
  
  104. And let there be a nation amongst you which calls towards good, and orders 
  kindness, and deters evil. And these are the successful ones. 
  
  105. And do not be like those who separated and differed after the clarity had 
  come to them. And for them is a painful retribution. 
  
  106. The day on which faces will be whitened and faces will be blackened; as 
  for those whose faces will be blackened: Did you reject after believing?, 
  taste the retribution for what you rejected. 
  
  107. As for those whose faces are whitened, they are in God's mercy, in it they 
  abide eternally. 
  
  108. These are God's revelations, We recite them to you with truth. God does 
  not want wickedness for the worlds. 
  
  109. And to God is all that is in heavens and in earth; and to God the events 
  will be returned. 
  
  110. You were the best nation that emerged to the people, you ordered towards 
  kindness and deterred from evil, and believed in God. If the people of the scripture 
  believed it would have been better for them; from amongst them are the believers, 
  but most are wicked. 
  
  111. They will not harm you except for being an annoyance, and if they fight 
  you they will turn their backs, then they will not be supported. 
  
  112. They are stricken with humiliation wherever they are found, except through 
  a rope from God and a rope from the people. And they stayed in God's wrath and 
  were stricken with humiliation; that is because they were disbelieving in God's 
  signs and killing the prophets without just cause; that is for what they disobeyed 
  and were transgressing. 
  
  113. They are not all equal, from the people of the scripture are a nation that 
  is upright, they recite God's revelations during parts of the night while submitting. 
  
  
  114. They believe in God and the last day and order kindness and deter from 
  evil, and they hasten in goodness; these are of the righteous ones. 
  
  115. And what they do of good will not be turned back, and God is aware of the 
  righteous. 
  
  116. As for those who rejected, neither their money nor their children will 
  avail them anything from God. These are the people of the Fire, in it they abide 
  eternally. 
  
  117. The example of what they spend in this world is like a wind in which there 
  is a frost; it afflicts the field of the people who wronged their souls and 
  destroyed it. God did not wrong them, but it was their souls that they wronged. 
  
  
  118. O you who believe do not take protection from any besides yourselves, they 
  will only disrupt you greatly. They wish that you suffer; the hatred appears 
  from their mouths and what their chests hide is greater! We have made clear 
  for you the signs if you comprehend. 
  
  119. Here you are loving them while they do not love you, and you believe in 
  the whole scripture. And if they meet you they say: We believe, 
  and if they are alone they bite their fingers out of frustration at you. Say: 
  Die in your frustration, God is aware of what is in the chests. 
  
  
  120. If any good befalls you it disturbs them, and if any bad befalls you they 
  rejoice with it. And if you are patient and righteous their planning will not 
  harm you at all. God is Encompassing all they do. 
  
  121. Recall when you departed from your family to prepare for the believers 
  their stations for battle, and God is Hearer, Knowledgeable. 
  
  122. When the two parties from among you were concerned that they would fail; 
  while God was their supporter. In God the believers should trust. 
  
  123. God has granted you victory in Badr when you were fewer, so revere God 
  that you may be thankful. 
  
  124. When you said to the believers: Is it not enough for you that God 
  would supply you with three thousand of the Angels sent down? 
  
  125. Indeed, if you are patient and are righteous and they come attack you, 
  He will supply you with five thousand of the Angels battle trained. 
  
  126. And God did not give this except as good news to you, and so that your 
  hearts may be assured with it. Victory is only from God, the Noble, the Wise. 
  
  
  127. To stop a portion of those who reject, or to disgrace them; then they will 
  turn back frustrated. 
  
  128. You will have no say in the matter, for He may pardon them, or punish them; 
  for they are wicked. 
  
  129. And to God is what is in the heavens and the earth, He forgives whom He 
  pleases, and He punishes whom He pleases; and God is Forgiving, Merciful. 
  
  130. O you who believe, do not consume financial interest multiplied, and revere 
  God that you may succeed. 
  
  131. And be aware of the Fire that has been prepared for the rejecters. 
  
  132. And obey God and obey the messenger so that you may obtain mercy. 
  
  133. And race towards forgiveness from your Lord and a Paradise whose width 
  is as the width of the heavens and earth, it has been prepared for the righteous. 
  
  
  134. The ones who spend in prosperity and adversity, and who repress anger, 
  and who pardon the people; God loves the good doers. 
  
  135. And those who, if they commit any evil, or wrong themselves, they remember 
  God and seek forgiveness for their sins. And who forgives the sins except God? 
  And they do not persist in what they have done while they know. 
  
  136. To these the reward will be a forgiveness from their Lord and Gardens with 
  rivers flowing underneath, eternally abiding in it. Excellent is the reward 
  of the workers. 
  
  137. Many nations have come before you, so roam the earth and see how the punishment 
  of the liars was. 
  
  138. This is a clarification for the people and a reminder for the righteous. 
  
  
  139. Do not be weak, and do not grieve, and you will have the upper hand, if 
  you are believers. 
  
  140. If you are wounded, then know that the other group is also wounded; and 
  such are the situations, We rotate them between the people, so that God will 
  know those who believe, and so He may take martyrs from you. God does not like 
  the wicked. 
  
  141. And God will test those who believe and He will destroy the rejecters. 
  
  
  142. Or did you think that you would enter Paradise without God knowing those 
  who would strive amongst you and those who are the patient ones? 
  
  143. And you used to wish for death before you met it, so now you see it right 
  in-front of you! 
  
  144. Mohammed is but a messenger of whom many messengers have passed before 
  him. If he dies or is killed will you turn back on your heels? And whoever turns 
  back on his heels, he will not harm God in the least. And God will reward the 
  thankful. 
  
  145. It is not permitted for a soul to die except by God's leave in an appointed 
  record. And whoever wants the rewards of this world We give him of it, and whoever 
  wants the reward of the Hereafter We give him of it. And We will reward the 
  thankful. 
  
  146. And many prophets had a large number of devotees fighting with them. They 
  did not crumble by what afflicted them in the cause of God, nor did they become 
  weak, nor did they become discouraged; and God loves the patient. 
  
  147. And they did not say except: Our Lord, forgive us our sins and our 
  transgression in certain matters, and make firm our foothold, and grant us victory 
  over the rejecting people. 
  
  148. So God gave them the reward of this world and the best reward of the Hereafter; 
  and God loves the good doers. 
  
  149. O you who believe, if you obey those who have rejected, then they will 
  turn you back on your heels and you will turn back as losers. 
  
  150. It is God who is your Patron, and He is the best victor. 
  
  151. We will cast terror in the hearts of those who rejected, because of what 
  they have set-up besides God even though He never sent down any authority to, 
  and their destiny is the Fire. Miserable is the abode of the wicked. 
  
  152. God Has made true on His promise that you would win over them by His leave; 
  until you failed and disputed in the matter and disobeyed after He Had shown 
  you what you cherished; some of you want this world, and some of you want the 
  Hereafter; then He turned you away from them to test you, and He Has pardoned 
  you. God is with great favour over the believers. 
  
  153. As you turned away and did not even glance towards anyone, and the messenger 
  was calling to you from the rear; so He gave you distress over distress so that 
  you will not be sad for what has passed you, nor for what afflicted you. And 
  God is Expert over what you do. 
  
  154. Then He sent down to you after the distress sanctity in sleepiness, it 
  overtook a group of you, and another group was worried about themselves, they 
  were thinking about God other than the truth, the thoughts of the days of ignorance. 
  They say: Do we have any say in this matter? Say: The entire 
  matter is for God they hide in their souls what they do not show to you, 
  they say: If we had a say in the matter at all then none of us would have 
  been killed here Say: If you were inside your own homes, then the 
  ones who have been marked for death would have gone forth to their resting place 
  God will test what is in your chests and bring out what is in your hearts. God 
  is Knowledgeable as to what is in the chests. 
  
  155. Those of you who turned away on the day that the two hosts met, it was 
  the devil who caused them to deviate because of some of what they had gained; 
  God Has pardoned them, God is Forgiver, Compassionate. 
  
  156. O you who believe do not be like those who rejected and said to their brothers 
  when they were advancing in the land or on the offensive: If they were 
  here with us they would not have died nor been killed. God will make this 
  a regret in their hearts, and God grants life and death, and God is watching 
  over what you do. 
  
  157. And if you are killed in the cause of God or die, then a forgiveness from 
  God and mercy is far greater than all they put together. 
  
  158. And if you die or are killed, then to God you will be gathered. 
  
  159. It was a mercy from God that you were soft towards them; had you been harsh 
  and mean hearted, they would have dispersed from you, so pardon them and ask 
  forgiveness for them, and consult them in the matter; but when you are convinced, 
  then put your trust in God; God loves those who put their trust. 
  
  160. If God grants you victory then none can defeat you, and if He abandons 
  you then who can grant you victory after Him? And towards God the believers 
  should put their trust. 
  
  161. It was not for any prophet that he should embezzle, and he who embezzles 
  will be brought with what he has embezzled on the day of resurrection, then 
  every soul will be given what it has earned without being wronged. 
  
  162. Is one who follows the pleasure of God, as one who draws the wrath of God 
  and whose abode is Hell? What a miserable destiny! 
  
  163. They are grades with God, and God is seer of what they do. 
  
  164. God Has bestowed favour upon the believers by sending them a messenger 
  from amongst themselves reciting His revelations and bettering them and teaching 
  them the scripture and the wisdom, and they were before in manifest darkness. 
  
  
  165. It was when defeat struck you; while you were defeated twice similarly; 
  you said: Where is this coming from? Say: It is from yourselves 
  God is capable of all things. 
  
  166. And what you suffered on the day the two hosts met was by God's leave, 
  and to let the believers know. 
  
  167. And to let those who are hypocrites know, that they were told: Come 
  fight in the cause of God or defend, they said: If we knew how to 
  fight we would have followed you They are closer to disbelief then they 
  are to belief. They say with their mouths what is not in their hearts, and God 
  is aware of what they conceal. 
  
  168. Those who remained and said to their brothers: If they obeyed us 
  they would not have been killed Say: Then avert death away from 
  yourselves if you are truthful! 
  
  169. And do not think that those who are killed in the sake of God are dead. 
  No, they are alive at their Lord receiving a bounty. 
  
  170. Happy with what God Has granted them from His favour, and they rejoice 
  for those who have yet to follow after them. There is no fear over them nor 
  do they grieve. 
  
  171. They rejoice with God's bounty and favour; God will not waste the reward 
  of the believers. 
  
  172. Those who have answered God and the messenger after they were afflicted 
  with wounds. For those of them who did good and were righteous is a great reward. 
  
  
  173. The ones who the people said to them: The people have gathered against 
  you, so be fearful of them, but it only increased their faith and they 
  said: God is enough for us, and He is the best to put our trust in. 
  
  
  174. So they came back with a reward from their Lord and a bounty, no harm would 
  touch them. And they had followed the pleasure of God, and God is the One with 
  great pleasure. 
  
  175. It is only the devil who creates fear upon his allies, so do not fear them, 
  but fear Me if you are believers. 
  
  176. And do not be saddened by those who rush into disbelief. They will not 
  harm God in the least. God does not wish to make for them any share in the Hereafter, 
  and they will have a painful retribution. 
  
  177. Those who have purchased rejection with belief will not harm God in the 
  least, and they will have a painful retribution. 
  
  178. And let not those who reject think that We are providing for them out of 
  the goodness of themselves. We are only providing for them so that they may 
  increase in transgression, and they will have a humiliating retribution. 
  
  179. God was not to leave the believers as they were without distinguishing 
  the rotten from the good. And God was not to let you know the future, but God 
  chooses from His messengers whom He wishes; so believe in God and His messengers. 
  And if you believe and are righteous, then you will have a great reward. 
  
  180. And let not those who are stingy with what God Has given them of His bounty 
  think that it is good for them, no, it is evil for them. They will be surrounded 
  by what they were stingy with on the day of resurrection. And to God will be 
  the inheritance of the heavens and the earth; and God is Expert over what you 
  do. 
  
  181. God Has heard the words of those who said: God is poor and we are 
  rich! We will record what they have said and their killing of the prophets 
  without just cause; and We will say: Taste the retribution of the Fire! 
  
  
  182. This is for what their hands have brought forth, and God does not wrong 
  the servants. 
  
  183. Those who said: God Has pledged to us that we should not believe 
  in a messenger unless he brings us an offering which the fire will devour. Say: 
  Messengers have come to you before me with clarity and with what you have 
  said, so why did you kill them if you were truthful? 
  
  184. If they reject you, then messengers before you were also rejected; they 
  came with clarity and the Psalms, and the scripture of enlightenment. 
  
  185. Every soul will taste death, and you will be recompensed your wages on 
  the day of resurrection. Whoever is swayed from the Fire and entered into Paradise, 
  he has indeed won. This worldly life is nothing more than the enjoyment of vanity. 
  
  
  186. We will test you in your money and in your selves, and you will hear from 
  those who have been given the scripture from before you and from those who set-up 
  partners much annoyance. 
  
  187. And God took the covenant of those who were given the scripture: You 
  will make it clear to the people and not conceal it. But they threw it 
  behind their backs and purchased with it a cheap price. Miserable indeed is 
  what they have purchased. 
  
  188. Do not think that those who are happy with what they have been given, and 
  they love to be praised for what they did not do; do not think they are saved 
  from the punishment. For them is a painful retribution. 
  
  189. And to God is the sovereignty of heavens and earth, and God is capable 
  of all things. 
  
  190. In the creation of heavens and earth, and the difference between night 
  and day, are signs for those with understanding. 
  
  191. Those who remember God while standing, and sitting, and on their sides, 
  and they ponder in the creation of the heavens and the earth: Our Lord 
  you did not create this without purpose, be You glorified, spare us the retribution 
  of the Fire! 
  
  192. Our Lord, whoever You admit to the Fire has been disgraced. The wicked 
  will have no supporters. 
  
  193. Our Lord, we have heard a caller inviting to the faith: Believe 
  in your Lord, so we have believed. Our Lord forgive us our evil deeds 
  and remit our sins, and let us die with the obedient. 
  
  194. Our Lord, and grant us what You have promised through Your messengers, 
  and do not embarrass us on the day of resurrection. You do not break the promise. 
  
  
  195. Their Lord answered them: I do not waste the work of any worker from 
  among you, be you male or female, you are all from each other. For those who 
  emigrated and were driven-out from their homes and were harmed in My cause, 
  and they fought and were killed, I will remit for them their sins and admit 
  them to gardens with rivers flowing beneath; a reward from God; and God Has 
  the best reward. 
  
  196. Do not be deceived by the movement of those who disbelieved throughout 
  the land. 
  
  197. A brief enjoyment, then their abode is Hell. What a miserable abode! 
  
  198. As for those who revere their Lord, they will have gardens with rivers 
  flowing beneath, eternally they reside in it as a dwelling from God. What is 
  with God is better for the obedient. 
  
  199. And from the people of the scripture are those who believe in God and what 
  was sent down to you and what was sent down to them; fearful to God, they do 
  not purchase with His revelations a cheap price. These will have their reward 
  with their Lord. God is quick in reckoning. 
  
  200. O you who believe, be patient and call for patience, and bond together 
  and revere God that you may succeed.
